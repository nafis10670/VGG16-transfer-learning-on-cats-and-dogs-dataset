# VGG16-transfer-learning-on-cats-and-dogs-dataset
This is a project where I use transfer learning from the VGG16 model on the cats and dogs dataset available in Kaggle. I derived the bottleneck features from the VGG16 model and trained three fully connected layers at the end of the model to classify cats and dogs. The VGG16 model is already trained on the Imagenet dataset and has the proper weights needed for my classification. 
I managed to achieve 89.89% accuracy on the training set and 92.95% accuracy on the validation set.
